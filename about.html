    <h1>What I'm About</h1>
    <p>
        I love learning how to make things--whether I'm cooking a new dish, writing an application in Python, building a circuit, or writing a piece of music. It seems to me that sauces, songs, and steam engines all work the same way; There are raw materials, which are turned into parts, which are combined into new things. The skill is in learning to pay attention to how the different parts interact with each other so that problems can be weeded out through troubleshooting: does this tomato sauce need more salt, oregano, or sugar? does this two-stroke engine need the high-, low-, or idle-screw adjusted? does this part of the program need an assertion, an if statement, or a debug message? does this instrument need more reverb, less volume, or more stereo width? Learning to better answer these kinds of questions is one of my favorite things to do.
